# Bootcamp Challenge 11 - Readme Generator

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)

## Description

This project was created using node.js with the fs and inquirer modules to make a command-line tool that generates a HTML portfolio page generator. I also added a webpage using the same module to make a different method of creating the readme.

The project had the following requirements:

- A command line interface that accepts user input.

- The project creates a professional readme with the following sections: Project title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, Questions.

- When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

- When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

- When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

- When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

- When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

- When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.

To use the node.js module, go to the root folder and run node index.js. Answer the prompts as you want the answers to appear on the readme file. After answering all the questions the readme will be generated in the output folder as readme.md.
