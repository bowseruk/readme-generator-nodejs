# Bootcamp Challenge 11 - Readme Generator

## Description 

This project was created using node.js with the fs and inquirer modules to make a command-line tool that generates a HTML portfolio page generator. The project had the following requirements:

In this activity, you will build a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

## Instructions

* Your application should prompt the user for information like their name, location, bio, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub URL. Feel free to add any additional prompts you think of.

* An HTML document containing the information collected from the prompts should be constructed and written to the file system. Be sure to add some CSS styling to the document.

* Youâ€™ll need the following tools and technologies to accomplish this:

  * `fs` for writing to the file system.

  * `inquirer` for collecting user input.

  * String template literals for generating a string version of the HTML document before it is written to the file system.

  * Promises for handling asynchronous behavior.


The page in this repo is the result.
